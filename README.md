## How to create a Next.js app using serverless functions, AWS Cognito and DynamoDB and deploy it on Vercel for free

Vexnimo is a full blown publicly available web app including authentication and database persistence using only free services. 

This is not as simple as using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) but AWS Amplify is only free for 12 months and Firebase limits you to only a handful of projects.

Vexnimo uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for frontend and serverless functions, [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as the database.
